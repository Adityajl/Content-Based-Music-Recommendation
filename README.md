# Content-Based-Music-Recommendation
One of the most used machine learning algorithms is recommendation systems. A recommender (or recommendation) system (or engine) is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a widely used technique in natural language processing and information retrieval for representing and assessing the importance of words in a collection of documents. It's a numerical statistic that helps quantify the relevance of a word within a specific document relative to the entire corpus. TF-IDF is particularly useful for transforming text data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can work with effectively. It's a crucial step in text analysis, document clustering, information retrieval, and various other NLP tasks.

Cosine similarity is a widely used concept in machine learning and natural language processing that measures the similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It's particularly useful for tasks involving text analysis, recommendation systems, and clustering. Cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which is a measure of their orientation and similarity, independent of their magnitudes. This makes it well-suited for comparing documents or feature vectors where the lengths of the vectors might not be standardized.
